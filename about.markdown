_This should all be in your head..._

Yes, memorizers, I know.

But then, let's have a break from using something everyday and after getting back to it after a while, are we still able to recall all the details?

Some do, some appreciate having written down notes.
Some people also remember best by creating, even if it's a thin blog post.

These are the purposes this place serves for me. A collection of concise tech-related notes and scribbles capturing the essence after exercising something, then serving as reference for later use with all the details in place.

So that I don't forget :)

I also have a [github]. Feel free to drop by.
