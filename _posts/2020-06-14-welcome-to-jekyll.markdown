I'm taking this opportunity to say _hello_ to The World and to `jekyll`.

I've been thinking about publishing notes and thoughts for some time already, just waiting for the right time and formula.

And tools. And this one looks nice enough.

OS-related notes will concern mostly _GNU/Linux_, while thoughts on programming won't probably fall far from _Python_.
That's at least my intention for now, but we will see how it happily turns out.

Welcome :)
